# ClockIn

One of the biggest challenges that the covid pandemic introduced in our lives was a chain of never-ending meets and links making it extremely tedious to keep track of all the events. This is where our website ClockIn has come to the rescue. Using ClockIn the users can add events to their calendar, edit them, get reminders through emails all combined with different view modes. Keeping track of meets from various ids can be tedious so ClockIn has the feature to include events from the user's google calendar making scheduling even more convenient for the user.
